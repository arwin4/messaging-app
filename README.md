# Messaging app

#### A pretty, mobile-first, real-time chat app.

This is a frontend implementation of [The Odin Project's full stack _Messaging App_ project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-messaging-app).

As the penultimate project in The Odin Project's curriculum, it showcases a ton of what I've learned during the course.
On the frontend, those are things such as React Router, custom reusable React components, socket.io, extensive CSS and a lot of interfacing with [the app's API](https://github.com/arwin4/messaging-app-api).

## Some notable features

These are highlights of the frontend only. Check out [the app's backend here](https://github.com/arwin4/messaging-app-api).

- Real-time rendering of messages and of the chats the user is in, using socket.io
- React Router loaders and actions
- Fully keyboard-accessible, all color contrasts WCAG AA(A)
- Mobile first, but adapts to any screen size
- Buttons with busy states
- Error handling for forms
- Custom modals
- Minimal use of libraries
